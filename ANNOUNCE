I am happy to announce Guppy-PE 0.1.12

Guppy-PE is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

The main news in this release:

Fixed test bug. Adapted for continuous integration at Travis.

License: MIT

Note that this package is for Python2 only which will be end of life
in 2020.  There is a fork for Python3, Guppy3 at:

https://github.com/zhuyifei1999/guppy3

You can still download Guppy-PE for Python2 from Python Package Index:

https://pypi.org/project/guppy/

You can use the following command as long as it supported and if all
is setup correctly:

pip install guppy

The project homepage is on Sourceforge:

Enjoy,

Sverker Nilsson
